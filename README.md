Jack Up CSS
===========

Simple stylesheet to add when still developing a website's CSS.  It basically
adds an outline and label to the top left corners of elements having the
`jackup` attribute.  The label shows that elements class attribute.  An extra
vertical line is added to the left that extends to the top to help show
vertical alignment with other elements.

Still a work in progress as I further develop this.  It seems like it may be
useful, but is far more limited then simply using a browsers web inspector
tool.  Could be useful when doing visual regression testing.
